Resurrecting a gemma board to run circuit python.

Not sure if my gemma is an M0

Plugged in and turned on.

Double pressed reset. Waiting and button went green.

I studied a project a while ago about reading IR code using PIO.

I didn't use it at the time, but it might be a great starting point for the H2 code generation.

```The latest Raspberry Pi OS is based upon Debian 11 (Bullseye) and with this new release we see the familiar raspistill and raspicam camera commands replaced with a new suite of open source tools dedicated to getting the most from all of the official Raspberry Pi cameras.

Libcamera is a support library for Linux, Android and ChromeOS which was introduced to the Raspberry Pi via a previous Raspberry Pi OS, but it has come into the spotlight due to the changes made for Bullseye. The app offers an easy to use series of tools which can tweak many different camera settings (aperture, color balance, exposure) via a series of switches issued when the command is invoked.``````
