I've started a new project and I'm very excited.

I'm going to be using this Tiny 2040.
This microcontroller is based on the same rp2040 chip as the raspberry pi pico, but as the name suggests it is in this tiny form factor - smaller than an SD card.

It supports circuit and micropython and has pin compatability with the pi pico, which I think will be important for using the PIO state machines of the rp2040.

The reason I want this small form factor is because I'm building a parasitic device, which will plug into and be powered from another device.

One of my design requirements is that I want this to run off 3.1v at very low current draw.
Now, the data sheets for this device are suitable vague on whether that will work - and that's understandable, because like any general purpose processor, the power use will vary based on the task you program it to perform.

So, I am going to run an experiment with some AA batteries before I hook things up in anger - and that's what this video will be about.
