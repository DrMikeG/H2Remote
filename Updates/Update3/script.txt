I've continued to work on one of my two designs for the IR remote transcieve for contolling my H2 Zoom microphone.

This design, which I expect to be the chunkier of the 2, is using a lipo battery and the adafruit feather 2040.

The case here is revision 7. It's printed in ocean green translucent PLA. It's quite boxy at the moment, but I will blend some edges in the final version.

I've made a three layer design for the case, which allows me to revise and reprint faster.

The bottom layer is holds the lipo battery and a switch. I've kept the JST plug on the battery - it adds a litle bit of bulk but its allows my to serpate the layers if there is a problem.

The middle layer is a frame for the feather, which adds tabs under the pcb mounting holes.

I've moved off of the breadboard, soldering the IR receiver and the 2.5mm jack plug to the relevant pins on feather.

The 2.5mm jack is loose and floating for now, so I need to be a bit careful handling the feather in this configuration.

The 3rd layer is the top of of the case, which secures the 2.5mm jack. 
There is a round window to expose the IR receiver, and a smaller adjacent window for the status LED - that will be more important on the final print which will be opaque not transparent.

Here the layers are secured with m2.5 machine screws. These allow good registration for the layers and make it easy to assembly and disassemble.
The final print will be in black PETG, and I will replace the m2.5 bolt holes and threads for self-tappers, which will look neater.

On the end here you can see the USB C socket which is broken out for recharging the lipo battery.

The IR receiver is using PIO capabilities of the RP2040
